It consists of all the tasks provided by TSF during my internship


# Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
